# How to create nTuples with the "Brunel nTupliser"

## Setup
In the `src/` directory of CMSSW, the Brunel nTupliser is downloaded from github
through the following command:

```sh
git clone -b <CMSSW_branch> git@github.com:davidcarbonis/NTupliser.git
```

Currently the branches available are `CMSSW_5_3_20` for Run 1 data/MC and
`CMSSW_7_4_7`, `CMSSW_7_4_14`, `CMSSW_7_6_3`, `CMSSW_8_0_5`, `CMSSW_8_0_12` and `CMSSW_8_0_25` for Run 2 data. This document
concerns using the nTupliser for Run 2 only.
 
See `README.md` for additional installation instructions for the relevant branches.

Once all packages required have been downloaded, CMSSW will need to be compiled
using the usual method:

 ```sh
 scram b
 ```
 
## Creating nTuples using Crab3

Within the test/ subdirectory there are configuration files called
`Crab3Config_MC.py` and `Crab3Config_data.py` which contain the necessary
scripting to run the nTupilser code in `test/nTupliserMC_cfg` or `test/
nTupliserData.py` respectively.

Before creating nTuples of either data or MC, it is recommended that the user
check the following:
* The Global Tag, as this defines the offline conditions data. Whilst the cfg
  files for the nTupliser are usually kept up to date with the latest Global
  Tag, it is recommended that the user double check as their dataset may require
  differing conditions or the cfg file may be out of date. Conditions can be
  found here:
  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideFrontierConditions
* The run range and luminosity mask for the Crab3 data config script. The
  various JSON files for luminosity and the relevant runs for each run of 2015
  data taking can be found here:
  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmV2015Analysis (N.B. Check
  elsewhere to confirm if there are any runs to avoid. At the time of writing, a
  number of runs for Run2015D have been excluded in the config file due to a
  poorly reconstructed beam spot). 
  For 2016 data taking, they can be found here:
  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PdmV2016Analysis (N.B. Check
  elsewhere to confirm if there are any runs to avoid.)
* Currently the `doCuts` flag in the MakeTopologyNtuple_miniAOD_cfi.py file is
  set to `True`. This applies a minimum number of leptons in the event cut to
  help reduce the file sizes and thus improve time efficiency. This value is
  controlled by `minLeptons` in the same python file. By default it is set to 
  `2` for the dilepton tZq analysis (particularly useful when processing the
  SingleElectron and SingleMuon datasets - removing events that'd never be
  considered). For events requiring fewer leptons, this value will need to be
  changed.
* For MC datasets, check the the value of the bool flag `isLHEflag` in
  `python/MakeTopologyNtuple_miniAOD_cfi.py.` In the past, dedicated MC samples
  with vaired factorisation and renormalisation scales coherently vaired for the
  Matrix Element and Parton Shower steps of the generator were created. For Run
  2 the per-event weights in the generator are available in miniAOD, allowing
  these systematics to be measured without the need for separate samples. The
  only exception to this are the tW samples which are created with Powerheg V1
  (this process is not available in Powerheg V2 yet) as scale variations on the
  ME level are not possible via LHE weights in Powerheg V1. Thus, in order to
  avoid CMSSW from finishing prematurely with an error regarding a missing item,
  this flag for Powerheg V1 samples must be set to `False`. All other cases, the
  flag can be set to `True`.
* For MC datasets where LHE information is stored (see above for `isLHEflag`),
  there are three additional parameters to be considered: `pdfIdStart`, 
  `pdfIdEnd`, and `hasAlphaWeightFlag`. These relate to the PDF systematics and
  strong coupling constant systematics which can now, like the vaired 
  factorisation and renormalisation scales, be measured using per-event weights.
  Given that the indices used for the stored weights vary depending on the sample
  and which PDF set(s) are included, the first and last indices need to be set by
  the user. The file `pdf_sets.xlsx` lists the ranges and which PDF set should be
  used for each sample. For Leading Order (LO) samples, the strong coupling constant
  weights are not avaliable and the `hasAlphaWeightFlag` has to be set to `False`.
  Otherwise, the weights have (or have been for all samples to date) directly
  followed the PDF weights, and the code is setup to look for these values when
  the parameter is set to `True`.
  
The dataset (listed under the parameter config.Data.inputDataset), the local
working directory (config.General.requestName), and the output dataset tag
(config.Data.outputDatasetTag) will have to be set by the user.

A list of datasets available in miniAOD for the most recent (and thus relevant)
campaigns, both MC and data, can be found on the CMS twiki (see below). Be sure
to use a version of the nTupliser corresponding to the miniAOD campaign used to
avoid incompatibilities.

It goes without saying that if the user wishes to do something different to the
norm in the nTupilisation process, they will need to modify
`nTupliserData_cfg.py` or `nTupliserMC_cfg.py` before running Crab 3.

Once the crab configuration file is set up, the usual formulas before running
CMS Software will need to be cast – ie. executing `cmsenv`. The user will need
to have a valid CMS VO certificate (this can be checked by executing
`voms-proxy-init -voms cms`.

To submit the job to the grid, run Crab 3. A short overview is given below, but
if you encounter any difficulty, the relevant documentation for using Crab 3 can
be found on the CMS TWiki.
1. Execute `crab submit -c <CRAB-config-file>` to create and submit the jobs.
   The `--dryrun` argument will upload the job and run a local test, informing
   the user of whether it will run and the estimated completion times, before
   prompting the user so that the submitted job can proceed.
2. Execute `crab status -d <dir-name>` to check the progress of the
   submitted jobs. One can get a more detailed status report by added `-—long` to
   the crab status command.
3. Once all the jobs have completed execute `crab getoutput -d <dir-name>` to
   retrieve the output of the jobs.

Once the output logs have been retrieved one needs to create a list of all the
files produced from the Crab jobs. For Run 1 there was a script to produce a
list of the T2 locations of the output produced using Crab 2. Given that Crab 3
is used now, and there is not an easy method to access the physical file names
(PFNs) and their locations, currently one has to retrieve the files from the T2
prior to skimming. A solution to avoid having to copy large files over to the
user’s area and skim the files directly from their T2 storage location is being
looked into.

In the directory `SingleTop/skimMacros/`, one finds the small program used to
produce the skims used in the analysis code. After compiling the exe, source the
setup file and run cmsenv (as it is implicit, I’ll state it explicitly, this
program needs to be located in a CMSSW setup) - in that order! Afterwards,
execute “skims.exe”:

In the directory `SingleTop/skimMacros/`, one finds the small program used to
produce the skims used in the analysis code. Compile and execute `skims.exe`:

```sh
make
./skims.exe -i <inputFileDirectories> -o <outputDataSetName> (--MC) 
```

N.B. 
The skim tool will only look for *.root files in the given directories
(space-delimited list).

Crab 3 and the skimming program have been run and tested only under
`CMSSW_7_4_7`, `CMSSW_7_4_14` and `CMSSW_7_6_3` by the author.

The author takes no responsibility for any unintended consequences stemming from
use of these instructions. They are meant as a guide only, to provide a starting
point and to give others documentation which he desperately lacked during his
student days.
